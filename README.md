###Modeling SIRD Epidemic Dynamics Using R and Shiny
This repository contains the code used to produce an interactive Shiny application which allows a user to manipulate various disease characteristics (infection, recovery, and death rate) in order to see their impacts on the progression of the epidemic in a model population.

I am writing a series of blog posts on this subject. This [introductory post](http://jpoles1.github.io/blog/2015/12/30/First-Model/) explains a bit about my approach and highlights the equations used for this model.

You can run this model locally (on your own Shiny server) using the command _runGitHub("shinySIRD", "jpoles1")_

You can also see this model in action by visiting a [hosted copy](https://jpoles1.shinyapps.io/shinySIRD) on ShinyApps.io (thanks to the R/Shiny team for providing this great hosting resource!)
